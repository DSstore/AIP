152702,27,4,4,b,37,32,new,,5ft 6in,avNYC,just right,small,668176,"I liked the color, the silhouette, and the fabric of this dress. But the ruching just looked bunchy and ruined the whole thing. I was so disappointed, I really waned to like this dress. Runs a little small; I would need to size up to make it workappropriate."
152702,26,4,5,c,36,34,new,,5ft 6in,lanwei91,slightly short,fit,320759,"From the other reviews it seems like this dress either works for your body type or it doesn't. I have a small waist but flabby tummy and this dress is perfect for me! The detail around the front hides everything and the clingyness of the dress makes me look curvier than usual. The material is thick but clings to your bum (enough that when you walk the bum jiggle shows through!) and the slit is a bit high so it's not necessarily office appropriate without tights, but it's a good dress with tights or for an occasion."
152702,,4,3,a,,34,new,,5ft 3in,angeladevoe5678,just right,fit,144785,I love the design and fit of this dress!  I wore it to a wedding and was comfortable all evening. The color is really pretty in person too!  The fabric quality seems decent but not great so I'm not sure how many washes it will make it through.
152702,25,4,3,c,35,32,new,,5ft 1in,Juli,slightly long,fit,52664,"I bought this dress for work  it is flattering and office appropriate.  It hits just above my knees and I am pretty short at 5'1.  Depending on how you adjust the top it can be a little low cut in the front, especially if you have a short torso. The material is on the thinner side, so should be great for summer/early fall and will work with tights underneath as well.  I love it!"
152702,25,4,5,c,32,32,new,,5ft 6in,lhalton,just right,fit,155439,This is a very professional look. It is Great for work !
152702,,4,4,a,,34,new,,5ft 3in,lennaroe,slightly long,small,986184,"I snagged this dress when it went on sale and wanted to love it but ended up returning it. I can see it being very flattering on a lot of people. For me it was a little snug and I'm really short so the length was a little longer. It's very thick and a very pretty color. It just didn't work for me, as much as I wanted it to."
152702,,4,2,c,37,32,new,,5ft 4in,samantha.bedore,just right,fit,525666,"I bought this dress based on some rave reviews. When I put it on it was...okay. The length is good and the fit is true to size (I'm 5'4, 120 pounds, and ordered a S), but the ruching at the waist was unflattering on me. If you carry a little extra weight around the tummy it probably does a good job of hiding it, but on me it just added bulk that isn't actually there. There's also some weird ruching on the shoulders that I didn't like. In addition, it's 84% polyester and seems like it would hold onto BO even after washing. I got it on sale ($40ish) but even at the lower price I'm returning it."

152702,,4,4,b,40,36,new,,5ft 2in,Charlene,just right,small,87742,This was another dress I got for my mom who's usually a size small but it was way too tight

152702,,4,5,a,35,34,new,34,5ft 3in,Catherine,just right,fit,671348,"I absolutely LOVE how snug and fitted the waist is but the top portion isn't flattering on my small chest.   It reminds me of wearing scrubs.  Other than that, the material is nice, stretchy, and thick and the color is very rich.  I'll have to find a way to make it work!"
152702,,4,3,b,35,34,new,,5ft,catherine.szczybor,just right,fit,512074,I loved this dress initially! The fit is superb and makes me look so vavavoom. Unfortunately after a few wears it started to pill. I still wear it but it isn't as chic.
152702,,4,4,d,35,32,new,,5ft 2in,Samantha,slightly long,fit,955268,"I love the color and fit of this dress. It really is flattering and VERY comfortable. It's sort of magical that it makes me look curvy without being tight and overly formfitting!However, it's worth noting that this dress isn't made for petites. It is quite long and sits at an awkward place below my knees so I may get it hemmed (5'2)."
152702,,4,5,c,35,34,new,,5ft 4in,nloomis,just right,fit,925412,"I was deciding between buying this dress and the Lady Love Song dress, but ultimately chose this one because the price was better and the color dark green holds a special place in my heart. I am SO HAPPY with this purchase, and will probably be on the lookout for more Klaxons brand dresses in the future. Like other reviewers have said, it is an extremely flattering cut and shape. I'm petite and it keeps my look slim while also adding curves I didn't think I had! Truly magical. I ordered a small, and I'm 5'4, 34/25/34, 115lbs."
152702,,4,4,a,,34,new,,5ft 8in,christinegallant,just right,fit,44686,"Colour is gorgeous, fit is absolutely perfect  the one complaint I have is that it's rather thin, and the quality is not ideal. Nevertheless, it is a classier dress that can be fancied up for special occasions."
152702,,4,4,dd/e,,32,new,,5ft 8in,barb.muhling,just right,fit,717049,"It's a cool dress that mostly worked on me. I bought it for work, but it's too tight and short to really be work appropriate, so I'll keep it for date nights. It generally fit well, had to do a little rearranging up top to squish everything in though, so if you're large chested, consider sizing up. The split at the back is too high, but I think I can sew it down an inch or so without too much trouble. Overall, for the price, worth trying!"
152702,,4,5,c,35,34,new,,5ft 2in,Jade,just right,fit,283925,"I bought this dress originally last year to wear for my older sister's wedding, unfortunately it didn't fit at the time and I was also kind of expecting it to be more stretchy so I wore a different dress. I kept it anyway mainly because I stuck it in the back of my closet and forgot it was there. I am glad I didn't return it though, because once I lost the extra weight (the reason it didn't fit) I wore this to another wedding of a dear high school friend about a month and a half ago and it fit perfectly and was comfortable and flattering. It was a tad snug in the under arm area and around my upper rib cage, but I have that problem sometimes with other dresses. It is quite versatile and I even started wearing it to work so it is finally getting some wear time."
152702,,4,3,d,34,32,new,,5ft 2in,Elise,just right,small,656771,I have an hourglass figure and I thought based on reviews this dress would be amazing. unfortunately the skirt was too tight through the hips. because of this the skirt rode up as well. the top is definitely work appropriate which is nice. the top seems reminiscent of the 40s which is fun. quality was good. wish it had fit better.
152702,,4,3,dd/e,34,32,new,,5ft 6in,harman.bonnie,just right,fit,164237,"Fit is perfect for a girl with curves (in my case, boobs and hips/bum) so it's great to find a flattering fit all the way around and not feel suffocated :)"
152702,,4,4,a,34,34,new,,5ft 6in,sami,just right,fit,466193,This dress fit fantastically!
152702,,4,4,c,36,30,new,,5ft 7in,peachmoon3,just right,fit,997347,I love that the material of this dress is thicker than you'd expect. It's also stretchier than you would expect which is awesome. I'm quite petite yet tall and the small fit perfectly. I can see how this dress would suit any figure or size because of the elasticity in the fabric and the draping in the front. Very flattering and super comfortable!
152702,,4,4,dd/e,36,34,new,38,5ft 8in,SARAH,slightly short,fit,96228,"This dress is lovely. Any dress that's thick enough I can go without wearing a slip  or even a bra  is amazing. I am taller than most girls, at 5'8, and all leg. This ran a little short on me. The front was fine, but the slit in the back went nearly up to my bum. Any time I would need to sit down, I'd be pretty much sitting directly on furniture. No thanks. I will be talking to customer service to see if they can tell me if there is a length difference in the sizes. I am also a little larger chested and this was almost too small, but I was able to stuff into the top, so hoping the next size up will be tight enough to go braless, but not so tight I'm worried about popping out."
152702,,4,3,c,39,34,new,,5ft 6in,lohan805,just right,fit,898371,"I love this dress!! I read all the reviews and what everyone said about this dress making your body look stunning is so true! You get it and freak out when you don't see a zipper or anything and wonder how you're going to get it over your head and whole body lol, but it does. Wore it to a friend's wedding and plan on wearing it to the rehearsal dinner for my own wedding in October!!"
152702,,4,4,c,34,32,new,,5ft,sarahlin.52992,just right,fit,225393,One of my favorite dresses to wear to work because of how gorgeous the forest green color is. Fits like a glove for professional vavavoom. Only issue is it's somewhat difficult to clean. Still love it and wear it to most presentations.#ReviewContest
152702,,4,4,c,,28,new,,5ft 2in,iachadiel,slightly long,fit,228715,"i love the dress. perfect for work or dates. little too long for my taste (just below the knee), but im a short one."
152702,,4,5,c,32,34,new,,5ft 2in,lizdero,just right,fit,260379,"I am just getting to the age of the Real Job Interview, and with that comes a lot of panic over what to wear. So much of women's work attire is boring and unflattering, but this dress is a stark opposite! I got it because it looked like it would do the job, but it blew me away when I put it on. I am the farthest thing from curvaceous, but the way this dress is fitted and has some draping on the waist gave me a figure! Actual curves! No way! The neckline is modest enough for business but shows enough collarbone to be very flattering as well. Before I bought it I was nervous that it would be modest to the point of shapeless teacher, but it is not so. Because there is no zipper, it can be a bit of a wrestling match to put it on, but it's just stretchy enough that I don't worry about popping any seams. After a little tugging here and there, it fits beautifully and stays put without constricting. The color is gorgeous as well. It's a little bit lighter than pictured. The length is just perfect for a business setting; it hits me right at the center of my knee and compliments my legs really well with heels. I highly recommend this dress for anyone seeking polished, simple, and smart without looking robotic."
152702,,4,4,d,,32,new,,5ft 3in,hillkathleene,just right,small,387368,"This dress is a gem. I bought it thinking I could wear it for both work and play, but it's a bit too clingy for the officemuch better suited to a date night. The color was rich and the length wasn't a problem for this petite girlit hit right around my knees. Fabulous dress all around."

152702,,4,4,,35,34,new,32,5ft 5in,Olga,just right,fit,829381,Happy with this dress. Fits just right. My only complaint is that it keeps riding up when I walk.
152702,,4,4,d,50,32,new,,5ft 4in,kel.schutz,just right,small,698640,"Absolutely jawdropping dress. You won't regret ordering it! The material feels heavier and substantial  like a quality garment. HOWEVER, be forewarned: it DEFINITELY runs small. I am typically an XS or S (02) and so I didn't listen to reviews and ordered S for myself. While it technically fits, it is tight across my chest and also a bit too clingy on the curves to be work appropriate, which is what I want it for. I'm exchanging it for a medium and some extra breathing room!"

152702,,4,3,,,,new,,5ft 6in,shelby.a.kline,just right,fit,7199,"The bunching across the stomach made me look bigger than I am, but I think that's just me being picky. Cute dress though."
152702,,4,5,dd/e,,36,new,,5ft 6in,silvaka,just right,fit,986830,I love this dress and the way it makes me feel. Perfect for the office and for an event. Color and quality was perfect.
152702,,4,5,b,,32,new,,5ft 3in,marissalgonzales,just right,fit,861773,"Who would've thought a dress with no zipper or buttons could fit so wonderfully? Fits like a glove and the ruching is very flattering. Fabric is a nice midweight, not too thick and not too thin."
152702,,4,3,b,35,32,new,,5ft 4in,Kristi,slightly long,small,503646,I think you have to have bigger boobs to fill this one out. Curves would work best in this. It hides no flaws. Just didn't feel good on. Sending back.
152702,,4,3,,,,new,,5ft,Leslie,slightly long,fit,377137,Nice shape. I just need to make it shorter because i am petite and it falls under my knees.

152702,,4,5,d,,32,new,,5ft 2in,petitefemmefrancaise,just right,fit,940650,The perfect combination of sexy and modest. The length and neckline keep it classy while the fabric hugs and flatters curves. Will be purchasing in navy as well.
152702,,4,3,c,36,32,new,35,5ft 1in,Taylor,just right,fit,537598,"This dress is not exactly petite friendly. I am very petite with a short torso, and this was fairly spandexy and everything just hit in the wrong place. With a very hourglass figure, this was not office appropriate on me! It's super cute, just didn't work for my figure."
152702,,4,3,b,36,32,new,34,5ft 11in,dbmcguire,just right,fit,35739,"Love this dress! The ruching is very flattering, and adds some curve appeal to someone tall and thin like me. The fabric is super comfortable and high quality. Because it's such high quality material the dress feels a little heavy...  Wouldn't recommend wearing during the hot summer but still a great buy"
152702,,4,4,d,39,34,new,,5ft 3in,spflipsen,just right,fit,642649,Fit wonderfully. So comfortable.
152702,,4,4,,,,new,,5ft 4in,jacquelyn.de.la.torre,just right,fit,343867,"Finally I have a cocktail dress! I love the fit of this dress once it's on. It's a bit more snug than the many other small dresses I've ordered from ModCloth, and since there's no zipper it's tougher to get over your shoulders, but it's a lovely slimming fit. I'm not crazy about the material since it seems like it won't breathe well at summer weddings, but I still prefer it to cotton or rayon because its shininess makes it more dressy. Just be aware there's no stretch. I got this dress in Plum, which some reviewers said had a high neckline issue, but if you just tuck the part that goes over your left boob under it, it's not a problem. I wouldn't recommend the dress for women much shorter than me because it hits right at my knee."
152702,,4,4,,,,new,,5ft 4in,mkwerlin,just right,fit,901104,High quality and very flattering fit on a hour glass figure! Love it!
152702,,4,4,d,30,34,new,34,5ft 9in,Sarah,just right,fit,693325,"The bunching can do weird things depending on your bust size... (worked for me but not as much for a lesstop heavy friend, she found it created a bunchy/odd shape) great dress for work. Only reason I returned was that the pine is considerably more turquoise than the dark green i was expecting."
152702,,4,3,c,,32,new,,5ft 6in,allisongranby,just right,small,271441,"Could use a liner, if wearing stickings, it will cling. I wasn't a huge fan at first but, with the attention I received when wearing it, I LOVE it now!"

They have been through a couple of seasons and still look good. They do pill alittle but that is after alot of wears. I want to get another navy one as a backup, as it is my favorite dress."
152702,,4,5,dd/e,32,32,new,,5ft 4in,ctydesign,slightly long,large,916851,"This dress is great quality but it is too big on me and doesn't look at all like the photo. It's really loose around the belly and hips area, so it just kinda sags and bunches up and makes me look like I have a major saggy kangaroo pouch. I think this dress is definitely more flattering on women with more in the hips department."
152702,,4,3,d,33,32,new,,5ft 4in,sylviaandrewartha,just right,small,573746,"Very cute dress but I should've listened to the reviews that warn how small it fits.  I have a fairly petite frame and I was still WAY snug  more in the rib cage than in the hips and chest.  I'm used to tight in the hips/thighs, but this thing was squeezing my ribs...not comfortable.  I think it's a great dress but I'll be returning for a medium."

152702,,4,4,d,,32,new,,5ft 4in,kerrie312,just right,fit,553100,Fits like a dream! Nice and snug on the smallest part of your waist. Hugs the bum well and shows off a great neckline. Hits perfectly above the chest  won't even have to pin it for work. Figure hugging and flattering without being too much for work. Beautiful teal/green. Very pleased to add to the wardrobe.

152702,,4,5,c,35,34,new,36,5ft 3in,Mary,just right,fit,790613,"I found this dress while looking for something to get for my cousin's black tie wedding. It really is a beautiful dress. It fits kind of tight, esp. around the bum, but not in such a way that it's not supposed to (if that makes sense). Also the length is long enough that it doesn't ride up to make you selfconscious that you're showing off anything you don't want to in public. Those folds along the waist are GREAT because the fabric is so soft and comfortable that without them you'd have a tummy bump but with them it's so stylish and pretty. The only problem I have is that it gives you a nice sexy bum bump like the pencil skirts Sandra Bullock wore in The Blind Side which isn't my thing. Anyway, the fit is nice, the length is cool and it lands right around/above my knees. I thought it was beautiful from the front but I had to return it."
152702,,4,5,c,34,32,new,,5ft 8in,rosencrayons,just right,small,626556,"This dress ended up going back. I was sad to make that decision because this dress is a beautiful color and a wonderful, soft and comfortable material. The cut does great, great things for the bust and waist but it seems to be flattering on everyone in the world except me.  I have bumpy, bony hip bones and this snug dress clings to them. It is very noticeable.  I even exchanged it for the Medium and the dress seemed to fit exactly the same as the small. I didn't bother with the large since there doesn't seem to be much difference between sizes. Oh well."
152702,,4,4,,37,,new,32,5ft 11in,Rachel,just right,small,465032,"Beautiful dress, and I was very excited when it finally arrived. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I was hoping for  the slit in the back is pretty high (I was drawn to the dress for its length, as a tall person), and it was a little tighter in the hips than I wanted it to be. I think it would have been fine for a fancy evening out but I'm looking more to expand my work wardrobe. That being said, the quality of the dress seemed very good the color is gorgeous, and the material is nice and thick."
152702,,4,4,b,36,32,new,,5ft 2in,kmkoenig323,slightly short,fit,221380,"Loved the color, nice thick material, but the bottom pleat just fell too low looked awkward and added bulk where there shouldn't be. For someone with a longer torso, this probably looks great."

It has a very 1950s vintage feel and as soon as I put it on I definitely felt like a female fatale from an old school detective novel.

It sat very high on my bust almost too much coverage, and it was very tight and unflattering in the midsection. I'm 5'6 140lbs with curves but not really a belly and it made me look like I had one!

I liked the color (darker than it looks in the photo) and the fabric was thick and felt highquality. But all the ruching on the stomach/hips looked totally weird on me. It felt like a lot of extra fabric over my belly. At the same time, the dress was tight on my butt and showed my panty line. I felt a bit like a mummy wrapped in a bandage :) I suspect this dress is bettersuited to someone with a curvier body."

It's very form fitting in the midsection, though I was expecting some form fitting based on the style, but not quite to the extent that actually happens. However, you can adjust the neckline very easily to fit your style, which I really liked!"

It's perfect for work, or when you need to look nice but keep it modest. I had a hard time with the fit, however. I'm pearshaped, and the dress has a smaller lower half and bigger upper half. My butt was squeezed in like sausage."

There is a lining to the dress that is forgiving to bumps and curves of the body, and boy is it soft. I think someone with a more dramatic bust or hip than mine would look amazing in it.

I bought it in a small, because the mediums were out of stock, and it just fits. The material is thick and stretchy.

I sort of disappear in the fabric, especially with the loose fabric draping in the front (that would be formfitting on someone even just 10 lb more than myself). I really wish it fit me properly because it is beautiful. The dress I received did not have a high back slit as some others had mentioned nor it did not gape in the front  the girls were covered. It was actually very modest on me, just not the right fit. I'm sadly returning this."

I often go for flowy skirts on dresses for fear of looking inappropriate, but this is both sexy and conservative at the same time. It's a lovely dark emerald color; I wore it to a fall wedding with pearls, black wedges and amethyst stud earrings. I feel like you could accessorize this so easily and dress up or down, as the fabric is rich but matte. The husband said I look like a pretty 50s girl which I'll take :)"

The dark color camouflages the polyester look, and I think material would be quick unbreathable. The neckline was at a really strange place for meit needed to be higher or lowerbut as is, it made me look really busty in an unattractive way. I ordered a S, which was the smallest size available, but there was extra fabric in the lower back, and all the ruching in the front actually just looked like extra skin. Just not the right dress for my body measurements."

WOW! I am in love with this dress! It's appropriate for work, weddings, a night out... It's really versatile, classy, and a little sexy without being clingy or inappropriate. You might need to pull it down a little while walking because it has a tendency to ride up (fortunately it's not super short on me!)"

I wasn't sure it would fit when it arrived, but as you pull it on it just keeps stretching and stretching. I'm short with thick legs, so the belowtheknee length was veryyyyy unflattering on me.

152702,,4,5,b,,36,new,,5ft 4in,Stephanie,just right,fit,486156,"I bought this dress on whim and it was one of my greatest purchases from this site! The material is very comfortable and very flattering on almost any body type. You may think the dress cut is too low in the chestarea, but it falls just right for me. I'm always selfconscious of my stomach area, but this dress finds a flawless way to slim it out. The small slip on the back is adorable. This dress is perfect for a business/work setting, and you can easily make it casual by slipping on a cardigan and casual shoes. Again, awesome dress!"

Yay!As awesome as this dress is, the hemline does tend to creep upward as you walk. Also, the dreaded VPL can be a problem because this dress is rather fitted in the behind, but with the right undergarments, it's not a problem."

My only complaint is that it could really use a zipper for easier getting in and out of it! Also, this is not as visible from the pictures, but the short sleeve has a tiny halfinch bit of a poof to it, which I would have liked to have spotted beforehand. Still, a great dress!"

The fabric feels clingy (you know the kind of clingy that makes you feel like you have unsightly bulges) but it definitely doesn't show in the mirror. The dress is cut in just the right way to hide the problem areas for a lot of women (hips, lower abdomen, love handles).  It has a fun modern 50s feel and is great for the office!"

Did I mention that it is also unbelievably flattering? It's a beautiful forest green and hugs every curve in the best possible way. I'm usually an XS or 00, and when I opened the bag to try this on, I thought, no way is this going to fit. I gave it a shot, and trust me, keep shimmying! It will fit!"

It fit like a sexy, classy glove on my 5'1 105lb frame, gave me curves instantaneously, and was modest enough to wear to work, where I got compliments all the livelong day. Even the girl at the Starbucks drivethrough poked her head out of the window to get a better look and admire it! This is my best ModCloth purchase yet and it had steep competition! The fabric sucks in your flaws and shows off the assets, and the material is heavy enough that I would wear it well into the cold months in fact, I look forward to it. It's going to be hard to top this one, and I HIGHLY recommend it!"

The heft of the fabric and the color and the subtle slit in the back are gorgeous. But on me, the waist was a bit loose. That combined with the cinching just made me look thicker than I am.Returning...but I would buy in a heartbeat if Modcloth carried this is XS!! Please do. :)"
152702,,4,5,a,37,34,new,,5ft 7in,Janet,just right,fit,501018,"This dress is just great! I bought it as my first ModCloth dress after reading the other rave reviews and I'm afraid I'm spoiled now.  It is a very slimming dress that stretches and recoils in all the right places to hug your curves, but in a good way!  I have rather wide shoulders for my waist size so I was worried I wouldn't be able to get it on easily (because of the lack of zipper) but it does stretch and go on just beautifully.  I wore it for a night out with my husband and enjoyed feeling sexy and classy at the same time!  It is a little darker than I expected (almost a forest green rather than teal) but I loved the color; it just wasn't what I expected.  I definitely recommend this dress!"
152702,,4,5,b,,34,new,,5ft 7in,jheringh,just right,fit,555681,I love this dress! It fits great. I'm usually an extra small and sometimes hesitate buying size small dresses online fearing it will be too big in the chest but I'm glad I took a risk on this one. The fabric is super comfortable and the length is great and work appropriate for sure (I'm a doctor in clinic all day). I've purchased a few Modcloth dresses and this is one of my favorites. Incredibly flattering. This is a great deal. You could easily find a similar dress for twice the price.
152702,,4,5,d,36,32,new,,5ft 4in,Mia,just right,fit,454909,"Wowsa! This dress fits super snug but with a good amount of stretch.  It is a very sexy dress but can still be appropriate for work.  The material is good quality and the color is beautiful.  I am pretty slim through the waist and ribcage and the dress fit like a glove.  However, I will likely wear Spanx if I plan to have a big meal while wearing it!  Overall I highly recommend this dress.  It's a 10!"
152702,,4,3,ddd/f,35,32,new,32,5ft 4in,ModLover,just right,fit,302413,"This is the most unflattering dress I have ever come across. I'm not sure what was going on at the top but as soon as I had the dress on my chest looked squished together. Even after some manipulation, I just could NOT get the dress to cover my chest without making me look boxy and strange. The rest of the dress fit my body nicely, but this top was so awful that it ruins the entire dress. I had such high hopes for this dress but this is going back immediately! Never been so disappointed in a modcloth dress."
152702,,4,4,,,32,new,32,5ft 3in,vo.sunset,just right,small,346423,"Gorgeous, classic dress. I wore it to a winter wedding. I'm normally a size XS, the small was a decent fit overall for my body. Modest enough for a family event or even work, but also very flattering. I love the longer length of this dress. Highly recommended. I took a star off because I received the dress with some thread undone by the back of the neckline. No time to exchange before the wedding, so I kept it."

I tried this dress with both a padded and nonpadded bra, and with and without spanx.While the dress is a nice dress (honestly, it is), it is not a FANTASTIC dress, and I was let down because I felt like it would be.  Main complaints: 1the dress bunches in the torso.  I felt like I needed to be longer in the torso to wear it, and I already have a long torso (I have to buy shirts in long to be able to tuck them in).  2. B/c of my hiptowaist ration, clothes tend to bunch at my hips, so anything gathered at the hip helps hide that.  The bunching was worse.  It gives me a pooch and leaves me feeling lopsided.  3. The cut of the dress does not flatter my bust AT ALL.  In the right clothes, I can look hourglassy.  Not in this.  Pear all the way. 4.  The color is more of a hunter green.   Maybe I should have gotten an M, but then the top would have been much too baggy to be able to wear.I am still keeping the dress because, frankly, I just don't have enough nice clothes to get rid of a nice and comfortable piece that can be easily accessorized, but I am still looking for another dress to wear to the occasion I purchased this for."

I was hesitant buying clothing online, especially dresses, but it was such a success that I wouldn't think twice about it in the future. I was slightly worried that the small would be too snug on me, but it fits like a glove! It shows off the hourglass figure I never knew I had, and accentuates curves very nicely. I agree with the other reviews that this dress is definitely a dark emerald green, not teal, but it is a beautiful color nonetheless. This dress hits me right at the knee and isn't too lowcut in the front, which was another selling point for me. The fabric is quite stretchy as well, making it a great choice for any body shape. It is super comfortable, and once I put it on, I never want to take it off! Thank you Modcloth, I will definitely purchase from you again in the future!"

It certainly did not disappoint!"

I wore it to work with a tan cardigan and my coworkers kept asking which big presentation I had that day. This is THE dress for the job I want. The only down side is that the stitching on the darts on the side isnt very strong. Fortunately it's strong enough to hold the darts together.

I am overall fairly thin but carry extra weight in lovehandles so I usually need a defined waistline/belt. HOWEVER, I gave this dress a try and the structure was firm enough that it ended up looking pretty darn good! It was fairly tight and not particularly forgiving in the back with lumps, bulges, etc. but the gathering in the front did smooth and flatter. I recommend Spanx if you don't have that perfect figure either! Very good buy, price is definitely worth it. Packs and travels well without wrinkling, and the sheen of the dress makes it appropriate for a dressy evening event."

After reading other reviews, I must agree that if you are bodyconscious this is a dress that you should order UP in. I am not a very big boned woman and decided to go with a Small. It is form fitted, lightly lined, and hugs your waist like no tomorrow:) I love this dress, classic and beautiful. I could have ordered up. Like another reviewer said, try it on with the right undergarments, the right shoes, and really give it a chance. No ZIPPER. Thank you ModCloth"

While the dress is the perfect style for an hourglass figure, I will say if you're between sizes with more hips than waist, go with the larger size. The fabric has a lot of stretch so it shouldn't hang loosely anywhere else. Would love to exchange this for a medium, but unfortunately I had to return it and will be anxiously waiting until it's back in stock!"

This dress will definitely bring out the cocacola figure on just about every body type. It hugs in all the right places, not too tight, and the material is a nice thick and comfortable cotton. There's a little stretch, so it fits true to size. I got a small, and although I could have sized up, I'm pretty happy overall with this purchase."

I was invited to a midFebruary wedding so I wanted to find a dark dress that wasn't sleeveless and when I saw this, I thought it was PERFECT.  I am average height, and not very busty and I ordered a small and it fits just right. With a padded bra, it will be even better.  My only issue is that I need to find shoes to match!  Very satisfied with my first purchase and I will be buying again :)"

This dress is perfect for work and could be dressed up for going out after. I'm 5'4 and it hits right about the knee on me.

It's very flattering on my hourglass/pear shape. The fabric is soft and stretchy, the green color is gorgeous and the ruching in the front really minimizes any tummy.

I was hesitant to buy it because I wasn't sure if a sheath dress could flatter my short stature, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance. It's designed in a way that enhances curves and obscures pudge in the tummy area, all while being quite comfortable. I did need to get it hemmed as with most of my dresses. The color is rich and goes well with nude shoes and gold jewelry. I've worn it to two weddings already and ready to show it off this holiday season!"

I've also fluctuated in weight between 135165 during that time and it's looked great on me at all sizes (I ordered it in M when I was probably in the middle of that range). It's such a perfect goto for any event. I've thrown a blazer or cardigan over it and worn it to work, but you can also go out in it at night and look great. It's also great in spring, fall, or summer weather! I've ordered probably 40+ things from modcloth over the years and this has been one of the maybe 3 items that has stuck around as a staple of my wardrobe. I'm at a heavier weight now so it's pretty formfitting but still EXTREMELY flattering. Anyone who has anything resembling hourglass proportions will look great in this dress no matter your weight.I will say that it does pill a little bit, but again, I'VE HAD IT FOR FOUR YEARS. So whatever."

The gathers in front are a little awkward but not enough to make me not want to wear it. I feel like it would have been way too bunchy if I had ordered a L. You want to be careful of what kind of underwear you wear with this dress. I feel like even a thing would show lines. Seamless spanx would be better. This dress cinched the waist and highlights hips and bust so well that you will feel like a million bucks! And the deep lustrous green color looks good on pretty much anyone.

The fabric is great, it's thick and a nice deep green. The cut is also very nice and it fits well, but the length is where it goes wrong for me. Somehow it hits this awkward spot just at the knees, so I'll have to tailor it so that it stops above. Otherwise it's definitely a keeper, and I can't wait to have a special occasion to show it off!"

It looked great when I first put it on and hit me right at the top of the knee. When I walked around (about 20 or less) however, the dress rode up several inches. This formed an unflattering pooch around my stomach and above my bottom. I tried a slip to see if that would help and it did not. I considered ordering a small to see if a tighter fit would solve the issue, but I think the slit in the back would probably show off my undercarriage if it hit any higher. I'm sad to say, the dress will be going back."

But the fabric on this one is stretchy, and it's great quality! I normally wear either a small or medium, and sized up just to make sure it wouldn't be too tight. The top can be adjusted so if you're going to wear it for more conservative occasions, you can arrange it so it's not as revealing. I loge the color!

I can move around in this dress as it has a bit of stretch. The pleats sort of camouflage any food babies I might have going on while still flattering the rest of my figure. The fabric is soft, though I would recommend wearing a slip or something similar to hide underwear lines. I like wearing it with silver jewelry and black Tstrap heels.There are a couple reasons why I wouldn't give this 5/5 stars: There needs to be a zipper. It's a bit of a struggle to get this dress on and off, especially if I don't want deodorant or makeup smudging on it. I think this needs to be hand wash only. There are a few pills on it now  sooner than I thought there would be. I would actually buy this dress again if it came with a hidden side zipper."

I am very chesty and have trouble with vnecklines often, but this is totally conservative and flattering at the same time.  The cross of fabric coming across is a bit of a mystery to me  does it cut right across my boob and lay flat?  Tuck under the boob?  Either looks good, and this dress checks all the right boxes.  Very versatile!"

The picture made it looks like a sheath with nice ruching to accentuate your waist.  But in reality it was very body con and fit like a glove.  That is just not a look I go for so I returned."
152702,,8,4,,,,new,,5ft 6in,Katie,just right,fit,281954,"Loved this dress! Wore it to a November wedding and it was just right. I do have to mention that the color is not teal at all, but more of a dark green."

It isn't too tight and the way it bunches at the side hid my mom tummy which I love. i did end up returning it only because it didn't flatter my chest, where it crosses at the top was kind of high and looked weird on me. Wish it worked, very cute otherwise!"

152702,,8,3,dd/e,39,34,new,,5ft 9in,rebekah.lueck,just right,fit,703788,Looks gorgeous on me. Only drawback is it's a bit thin so I have to wear a slip with it. No big deal though because what girl doesn't have some spanx on hand?

The pleating is a little weird on the right side but luckily I was big enough by the time I had to wear it that it stretched out and laid flat. I got TONS of compliments all night and it is such great quality that I know I'll have it for years. I wouldn't size up unless you are pregnant like me :)"

152702,,8,4,b,37,34,new,,5ft 3in,akruton,slightly long,small,50760,The color to me is closer to hunter green than teal but I still love the fit and feel of this dress.  I'm 5'3 and 115 lbs and the Medium was a little loose but I felt that made it more work appropriate anyway.  The length was just at my knees which is ok but maybe an inch shorter would've been preferred as dresses that hit my knee make me appear shorter than I am.  Lastly it is NOT cut too low on the chest  you can adjust it as needed if you are small to medium busted.
152702,,8,4,,,,new,,5ft 6in,Meowster,just right,fit,737718,It definitely shows off your curves and I love it. I wish there were more colors. My only gripe is that the slit in the back comes up higher than I was expecting but I have since gotten used to it. It also requires a bit of effort in getting out of the dress lol
152702,,8,2,c,41,36,new,,5ft 2in,Gina,slightly short,small,474933,It's a very pretty color but the material wasn't exactly what I was expecting. And it was a little snug too

152702,,8,2,,,,new,,5ft 9in,jaimie_cs,slightly short,fit,435057,"Not really what I was expecting. Cut is good, I don't mind the higher chest cut and the rouching is good, love the colour... But it's not just unlined, the seams are unfinished. The slit in the back is very high and the material isn't thick enough to cover any lumps and bumps, it's not too bad in the front, but the back isn't good. It's also really hard to get on and off, which is just a pet hate of mine."
152702,,8,3,ddd/f,,32,new,,5ft 3in,iheartbillgates,just right,small,379668,"The color is definitely more of a hunter green than a teal, but it's still beautiful. The fabric provides and bit of a stretch, which is good because this definitely fits a bit more snugly in the waist and hips than other dresses I've ordered in the same size.The best part about this dress for bustier women is the top. I was expecting to have to wear a camisole underneath to keep things under wraps, but the tightness of the wrap and the waist actually keeps the neckline where you put it. Overall, very flattering and versatile."
152702,,8,3,d,39,32,new,,5ft 4in,Elizabeth,just right,small,859074,Loved it but too small the waist fit just right but both the bust and hips were way too small. I usually wear a small and Never wear a large the medium was still verrry tight. size up on this one!! Also a little long for my 5'4 frame. Would have been fine in tall heels but not anything less.
152702,,8,4,a,39,34,new,,5ft 3in,serenacpm,slightly long,small,185610,It fits like a glove and I love the colour. But just a it too curverevealing that I need to get a size up. Returning it.

Sadly, I had to return it. I'm not going to wear Spanx (I don't even own any) and I wanted a shorter length (at or slightly above the knee is my preference)."
152702,,8,2,d,32,32,new,,5ft 6in,tammcclinton,slightly short,small,32318,the rouching was not smooth across the bust. A little too short. The teal color is gorgeous though.

I ordered a medium and it hugs my curves snugly. Incredibly versatile  it's quickly becoming a favorite for work, but also works well as a dinner date dress."
152702,,8,5,,40,34,new,,5ft 2in,ke31082,just right,fit,156532,Super flattering and amazing fit! I could dance all night in this stretchy dress!

Glad I did ,because the dress tends to ride up on my hips a bit. There is a bit of extra fabric that gathers around my stomach, so if you have a small waist and wider hips it may do the same for you ( this may be where a small would have been a better choice ) . The color is gorgeous , but is a bit of a darker teal/ green than what it shows in the pictures online. I love the top and how much or little coverage you can control due to the wrap style. Overall I love the dress and for the price I am very satisfied"
152702,,8,4,b,,34,new,,5ft 6in,Kelsey,just right,fit,947191,Very flattering dress  both in fit and length! Could wear to work or event. Only negative is the dress rides up a bit as a result of the ruching of the fabric.

The colour is rich, the fabric is just extensible enough it holds everything in place (with of course the right undies) I am uncertain about the quality of the fabric so I will be extra careful washing. Again the colour, the price and the soft feeling makes up for it. I was looking for a dress I could wear for the cabaret acting number of a swing dance competition. And something I could also pull off at work dressed down a little .. This dress totally cuts it ! I have a long torso so when decided on the M for the fit, I knew my strongest measurement (41 hips) would be lower then most people and The sizing would be right for me ! It was absolutely perfect! The compliments I got on the fit and colour were numerous."

Since it fits ok, and I don't have time to send it back and get something else, I'll end up wearing it. The only complaint I have is the ruching  it starts a little too high so it just looks kinda weird and is not as flattering as I'd hoped it would be."

I have a small chest and the dress is definitely made for someone with a small bust line.  I even have a bit of room.  I originally bought the dress for work, but it is too tight for my office environment.  However, it will be a great dress for date night with my husband or an evening with my girlfriends.  The only thing I am not thrilled about is the slit in the back. Since my legs are muscular, the slit doesn't lay flat nicely.  But, my husband said he couldn't tell.  Overall, I love the color and fit of the dress.  The gathers in the front/side are very forgiving for the mid section."

It is for the woman who has curves and doesn't care about lumps or bumps, because this dress will be very snug around your butt. The ruching around the waist is very pretty and flattering. Because it is snug around the butt and hips, it tends to ride up so the slit may end up being kind of high. No matter, hike the dress down and wear it with pride."

It's forgiving on those of us that have a little bit more curve on the bottom half. Very modest  vneck and knee length. I've been coming to modcloth for unique dresses, but unfortunately, there isn't much for value. I've found numerous dresses $20$50 less on  other websites.

It hugs the figure really well, but does run small so I had to size up because I don't like my dresses to be skin tight. The only complaint I have, like other reviewers, is that the slit in the back definitely goes high enough to make me selfconscious. I just put a few extra stitches in to make myself less paranoid.

Both myself and my best friend have this dress, and we have very different body types as well as skin tones and it fits both of us FLAWLESSLY. I love it so much I bought the one in navy as well, I would have bought the pink one but they were out of my size. This is perfect for so many occasions weddings, dinner dates, etc. and the material is not itchy (a pet peeve of mine) nor does it seem to be in danger of falling apart like many dresses you buy at the mall. In addition, while it is V neck it is in no danger of showing too much boobage, which has been a problem for me in the past. The rouching on the side helps to hide any tummy pudge, and I was happy to learn when I tried it on on that I wouldn't require spanx or any fussy undergarments.

The design is smart as it is sexy yet feminine and the folds enhance your shape (or hide trouble areas;). Length hits at the knees, so wear heels if you are short like me. The top part fits me kinda weird over my chest, I have to rearrange the garment, but not a deal breaker. Hopes this helps."

152702,,8,5,dd/e,38,32,new,,5ft 2in,Rachel,slightly long,fit,485669,"After the amazing reviews I was not stunned to find I love this dress. As previous reviewers have stated the lack of zipper can be a bit intimidating, but this fear is unnecessary. This dress easily slips on and hugs in all the right places. The fabric is soft and comfortable. Because I'm short I found it a tad long (hits just below my knees). Seeing as it is more of a forties style dress, it being a bit longer doesn't matter. The length also provides a sort of freedom from worrying about the dress shimmying up during movement. Even if it does your still amply covered. There is plenty of coverage in the chest as well, enough to show your a lady but not too much as to prove otherwise.  I cannot wait to wear it out."

I got the medium, which is what I usually wear, and it's pretty tight, but it has folds over the stomach area so I think it is still flattering for someone like me who has hips! It can be hard to get on, since it's a dress you have to pull over your head and doesn't have a zipper."

Love the color but the fit it sort of weird. I have a bigger bust and a small waist and even though it fit's great in the bust, the waist seems a bit saggy. The hips fit pretty nice too. I don't think I'd be able to pull off a Small. Maybe with some shape wear it will fit better but I ordered another mod cloth dress so I can decide which one to keep."

I put it on and thought I looked great,  then I turned around and my boyfriend started laughing because the slit revealed parts of me that the public has no business seeing. Oh well... tall girl problems."

I'm super short so it's a little long on me and the sleeves are a little poofier than I expected but it hugs in all the right places and I love the color.  the material is stretchy, kinda casual but I dressed it up for a rehearsal dinner and also wore to a work function."

What I like about it most is that it's conservative with a sexy flare. The color also looked good on my untanned skin and dark hair.

I am tall, relatively thin and have trouble finding a dress that is the right length with decent boob covereage. This one was just the right length for me. Also, you can decide if you want more or less cleavage with this dress! def less for the work function willl work nicely"

Something closer to dark teal/forest green, but still a lovely colour. I ended up hemming mine a few inches as it fell below my knees which felt too long for my 5'0 frame.Wonderful dress that makes me feel so good!"
152702,,8,3,b,35,32,new,,5ft 6in,karenannkelly,just right,small,988243,"I sent this one back because the small was too snug for work. I'm usually a s/xs but went for the medium bc it looked form fitting. Sadly that was a hit tight on me too. The material is not very heavy, but is comfortable for a long day at work"
152702,,8,3,c,38,36,new,,5ft,lauren43090,slightly long,large,547272,"In the online photo the fabric looks more sheen than it really is. I thought the color would be brighter as well judging from the picture. Otherwise you'd be hard to find a body type this dress doesn't flatter. For me it was a little long, going an inch past my knee, this caused the proportions in the hip to be a little off so I will be getting I hemmed (which when your short you get use to). It's a great work dress though the material is a little heavy so not a July dress. Other wise this was a great buy."

152702,,8,4,b,39,32,new,34,5ft 9in,Erin,just right,fit,396013,"I bought a medium because I have very curvy hips, but I don't think a small would have fit in my chest anyway. The top is very fitted along the shoulders and bust. It's a little baggy in the tummy area but the ruching hides it. Great quality too!"

When I first tried it on, I didn't like how the overlapping layers bunch up at the waist, but if you pull the inner layer down when you first put it on, then the dress looks fine. I get compliments whenever I wear it. I also love the color, although it's not teal; it's a dark green. Beautiful."

I love it because it definitely hugs my curves in a way that's flattering and is just sexy enough to wear out but still classy enough to wear to work. My only concern with it is that it's almost too sexy in the bottom region. I have a giant butt and it looks awesome in this dress (seriously!), but calls a little more attention than is appropriate for an office setting. Luckily, I just throw a long cardigan over it and it's PERFECT. I would recommend 100%"
152702,,8,5,d,32,32,new,,5ft 6in,Perrie,just right,fit,836312,LOVE this dress! The color is a beautiful emerald color and the cut is very flattering. Long enough for work with a great pair of pump or even a blazer if it's a little chilly outside. I get lots of compliments on this dress.

I was so hopeful, but I should have gotten a Large and I may have looked better.  But really I don't think that would have helped.  It isn't forgiving for the curves but that isn't why I had to return it.  If you get the wrong size it'll smash the girls in and that is never a good thing."

It's very comfortable and seriously flattering; I have gotten more compliments in this dress than in anything else I've ever worn. I wore it to an award ceremony and a fall wedding, and it was pitch perfect for both. Since the neckline is wrapstyle, you can even control how lowcut it is to a certain degree. Only complaint: one of the ruching seams tore after its first wear, but I got my dry cleaning place to sew it up decently. Still, I'm very glad I bought this dress!"
152702,,8,5,b,34,34,new,,5ft 7in,amandalee2612,just right,fit,675654,"Sexy dress! Probably my favorite just because it's so flattering on. It makes me look like I have an hourglass figure when I really don't. Beautiful pine green, thick but soft material. Covers your butt, and not too low cut.

Unfortunately, I have to send it back. The dress itself fits (tightly) everywhere. But the decorative gathering actually makes the impression of a stomach pooch where there is none. What?! I think there's just too much fabric in the folds for my small frame and it bunches together. That coupled with the fact that the bust ran a bit smaller than I'd hope and compressed the girls a bit means it goes back in the box. I'm so sad about this one."

Boy was I wrong, the fabric isn't thick, but it's still soft and high quality. The vneck can be adjusted a little to show as much or as little cleavage as you'd like. It fits amazing and makes me feel like a pinup model. My husband loved it, too! The color is more green than teal in person which suits me just fine."
152702,,8,4,b,,34,new,,5ft 5in,Mysterious Muffincakes,just right,fit,968845,"For the price this is a wellmade, comfortable dress. The dress is cozy and will keep me warm this coming winter. I plan to wear it to my friend's bridal shower, but I also think it would be great to wear to an interview. It's a little tricky to get into but the material stretches and creates a very flattering fit.  I typically wear size S but because the dress is made of stretchy material so I decided to size up."
152702,,8,4,ddd/f,37,28,new,,5ft 9in,cakemeows,slightly short,fit,509497,This dress is very sexy. Unlike most tight fitting dresses it really does show off all the right parts. It's especially nice for those of us who have belly pouches.I disagree with all of the comments suggesting the dress is super stretchy...it is stretchy but not that much so. It was a pain to get over my wide shoulders and sits rather tight across my back. If it shrinks at all I'll have to go up a size which may not work as it currently looks stunning everywhere else!The back slit is not long but the dress (on me anyways) comes only about 6 inches past my butt and the slit is about 5 inches of that  so yeah dangerous territory there...

I ordered the medium and while its still snug it isn't as bad as the small was. I love the ruching at the waist  it is extremely flattering and makes your waist look that much smaller. Looks lovely with a blazer in the spring/fall and on its own in the hot summer months.
152702,,8,4,d,40,36,new,,5ft 8in,sunshinernstc,just right,fit,450217,"I have never had so many people stop and stare at me.  This dress is as comfortable as wearing casual muckingabout clothes but looks amazing.  I got a medium, based on reviews.  It's a bit big in the waist, but that's because of my waist/hip ratio. The slit in the back of the skirt did come up a bit high  I sewed it shut so I didn't end up with a duck dress.  But allinall:  Yowza!  Sexy and still appropriate for work!"
152702,,8,5,ddd/f,,34,new,,5ft 6in,Emma,just right,small,938561,"This dress is perfection.  All the other reviews are correct and really sold me on this lovely piece.  I was nervous when I took it out of the package and saw how tiny it looked, panicked when it felt super tight on my body, but relaxed and smiled when I looked in the mirror and saw how great I looked.  I walked out into the living room and my fiance said You look sexy.  I knew I had a prize on.  Thank you Modcloth for once again selling me a beautiful, quality dress.  I feel so confident, beautiful, and sexy wearing this wonderful dress.  One note of caution, the slit in the back is HIGH.  It goes up to my butt but it doesn't show anything  not even when I bend over."
152702,,8,3,c,35,32,new,,5ft 5in,natasha.augustin,just right,fit,970438,I bought it for work so loved the length and the colour it is a much richer colour in person. I sized up probably should have stayed with an S as it was large in the hip area and the material is stretchy mind you it fits perfectly in the chest area so could really have gone either way.
152702,,8,4,b,,36,new,,5ft 10in,Sarah,just right,fit,483323,"Fantastic dress, very classy and flattering. I thought that the color in the picture was fairly accurate. The length hit me just above the knee, but I did have a problem with it riding up occasionally. Also, the material feels nice and is thick enough, but it is synthetic and does not breathe all that well. It is a stretchy fabric but it's not cheap looking. Also, I found that correct undergarments help a lot with this one. For the price, I thought this was quite a deal."

This dress clings enough to be sexy, but can still be worn in a professional setting. The wrap is also great for highlighting and embellishing curves. The slit in the back is higher than anticipated, so if you've got long legs like I do be careful of that, but otherwise the dress is a dream."

The fabric is thick and wrinklefree, and the cut is extremely flattering for all sizes.  I'm extremely curvy and it brought out my small waist compared to large hips without making my hips or butt look *too* large.  One of my much less curvy friends tried it on, and it did a nice job of bringing out her bust and showing off her gorgeous willowy frame.  The color is more forest than teal, but it's still not an unflattering color.  I'm extremely happy with this dress."

It's a super cute fit, the material is just a tad on the thin side so that it clings to every lump and bump. The color is actually exactly what I would have expected it IS teal. Length is great, and it's sexy without being overthetop obvious, which is always my goal!"

The Vneck and tight sleeves made my upper body appear smaller, exaggerating my pear shaped figure in an unflattering way."

At first I thought that it was going to be too tight, but I put it on and it fit perfectly! The material is stretchy and not see through at all, so you don't feel like if you have any bumps or bulges that they're going to show. I wore it with simple black heels and felt fabulous!"

It fits just fine. The colour is a darker green that expected, but a really pretty shade still. The fabric is thicker than expected, but I guess bra/panty lines would show if it wasn't likie this."
152702,,8,5,d,,32,new,,5ft 4in,alunette,just right,fit,649202,"Taking it out of the plastic bag, you have no idea of the genius you are holding in your hand.  You slip this garment over your head,and, for an instant, you are alarmed by the lack of a zipper  as you encounter a brief resistance pulling the dress over your shoulders.  And then, before you can even frown, the dress is on, caressing your body like a lover.   It is as light as air, lined only across the bodice, but substantial enough to make a slip unnecessary.   Finally, this amazing dress smoothed and in place, you turn and face your reflection in your mirror, only to beholda goddess!   Never have you looked so slender and curvaceous all at the same time and so COMFORTABLE!  You turn to look over your shoulder and see,again, a lovely sightyour tush is gorgeous.OK, so the dress fits TTS and is effortless to wear.  The neckline, which looked a little low on the Web site,  is perfect., wanting only a great locket or necklace to help set off your fabulous new dress.    The ruching across the midriff is enough to smooth away any little pouch you think you have, but adds no volume.  The length of the medium was perfect for me just covering the knee. Because the fabric may not be so durable (rayon and polyester) I am buying ANOTHER one, for when (if?) this dress starts to pill.  I can no longer live without it!!!!!!"
152702,,8,5,b,38,34,new,,5ft 9in,Angela,just right,fit,316835,"This dress is great! The fabric is very soft and cozy. The cut is very figure hugging and flattering. The gathered fabric accentuates my curves (waist/hips) in a great way, and forgives the curves I don't have at the top. The color is a lot darker and greener than I had expected. As another reviewer said, I would probably call it emerald rather than teal, but I still love it. Party, wedding, work  this dress will go anywhere with me!"
152702,,8,5,c,38,34,new,,5ft 9in,Carolyn,just right,fit,886250,"I had my eye on this dress for awhile in the Magenta color and when Modcloth offered this in green I jumped at the chance. I kind of like the fact that there's no zipper on this dress because it keeps it from puckering like some other ones do.  The ruching does a pretty good job of smoothing bumps but I'm definitely gonna have to be careful about undergarment selection with this.  Also, this dress is form fitting (especially in the hips area for you ladies with bigger ones like me) so if you want it to be a little looser, I might size up.  The quality of the fabric is good and the length is perfect for taller girls.  Love it!"

I usually am an L or XL in ModCloth clothes, and I decided to spring for the L after so many reviews talked about how stretchy this dress is. Well, it's stretchy all right  I didn't have any issues putting it on  but it was not at all flattering. It LOOKED way too small and I felt a little like a sausage. It showed every last curve and bump. I would have needed an XL or even a size larger for it to be at all work appropriate. It's too bad, because the dress itself is very pretty  a nice dark green (but still noticeably colorful) and thick fabric, and well cut. It's just not for people with a little weight on, I guess."

The draped pull is pretty but hung weirdly on me. I was a little worried that my small bust wouldn't fill out a large, but no problems there! I'm also tall, so dresses this length are hard to come by. The color is also pretty and the material is thick and soft. Ultimately, it just didn't wow me, and the weirdness over my stomach made me self conscious. Back it went!"

152702,,12,4,d,41,34,new,,5ft 8in,Shannon,slightly short,fit,577736,"For me, this dress was a miss.  There was a voluminous amount of fabric around the waist, leaving saggy bits about the tummy that created a tummy rather than disguised it.  Yet, the hips were very tight, uncomfortably so.  I also didn't like the dull green color. It wasn't the jewellike forest green I had hoped for.  I returned it."
152702,,12,5,c,39,38,new,,5ft 11in,mckenna_t,just right,fit,31884,Love it. Great dress for work. Classic style and flattering fit. Material is thick and stretchy so smooths out bumps. I'm 5'11 so length is perfect for me. This is a large as I don't like dresses to be really tight.

The cut in the front seems to fit oddly across my chest, so I either have to pull the underneath layer up and over my chest and then it doesn't feel comfortable, or try to pull it down (to lay under my breast), but then it's cleavage central and doesn't quite look right. Hmmm...maybe I'm just wearing it wrong somehow."
152702,,12,2,,35,,new,,5ft 9in,Marie,slightly short,small,119510,Fit was tight with no give and the slit was right to my butt. Ran small with no forgiveness.

The ruched edging does a pretty good job of masking my post baby tummy and with some shape wear, I'm hoping my fabulous hips will smooth out as well. The color is amazing and the neckline does wonders for my cleavage. I do love the dress and I'm hoping that as I start to shed some baby weight it'll look even better. #reviewcontest"

But be warned, it is VERY tight, like second skin tight.  I originally ordered a medium, because I was going off of the measurements on this site, and it was rather inappropriate.  The large fit much better, but even then the skirt had a tendency to rise up a little bit.  I marked it down one for quality because one the seams at the waist was ripped and I had to have it repaired.  All in all though, this is a great dress, I highly recommend it.  #ReviewContest"

First, it's slightly too big, but based on the material, a medium likely would've been too tight. It's not as flattering in person?the material looked really cheap.

The fit was the correct size, and it almost looked great, except the tummy made me look pouchier than I am, and the front hem dipped down too long compared to the back. The chest was tight, too. I could see this working for someone and being very flattering and comfortable on another body type, if the quality was there, but not mine."

Looks best with panty hose or some shape wear, since it is pretty form fitting, keeps a nicer siloette that way."

I had wanted this for a wedding, but the color was so off I had to return it. It was also very form fitting. The draping on the side was nice and helped camouflage any tummy issues, but even the large was a little snug."

I was a bit nervous when I ordered it because I don't normally wear such formfitting clothing (I have pretty big hips and am selfconscious because of that), but after putting it on and getting use to the fit I felt AMAZING! The bottom was a bit tight and I did have issues with it riding up when I was dancing, but i felt so good about myself that I did not mind that little annoyance. The top top showed just enough skin that I felt sexy and classy at the same time. I can't wait till I have another opportunity to wear it"

Hides the tummy really well but any love handles can be seen, same with underwear lines definitely needs some shape wear underneath! The length is perfect classy but sexy, falls above the knee but I could bend over and not give anyone a show! Literally no cleavage shows, I'm a 36D and expected a bit more cleavage with this dress. Overall I like it, it's made really well, the fabric is pretty thick. If you are bigger than a size 10 this won't fit you. On the upside by butt looks great in it :)"

I considered keeping it for a special occasion dress (my hubs did NOT mind the tightness aspectlol), but I felt uncomfortable in it after wearing it only a few minutes, as the fabric feels very thick and not breathable.If the fit were better for me, I think it would be a winner but, unfortunately, no dice."
152702,,12,4,dd/e,41,34,new,,5ft 4in,rachelfanguy,just right,fit,976653,"I love this dress. It's a beautiful color, the material is thick without being too heavy, and the cut is wonderfully flattering. The length is great, it hits right at my knees. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ruching/gathering just doesn't lay right across my middle. It may be because I'm not very tall, but it just looks kind of wrinkled and weird instead of the graceful drape on the mannequin. But I don't care, the rest of the dress is wonderful."
152702,,12,3,b,,38,new,,5ft 2in,amiedurgin,very short,small,923357,Cute dress but cut very slim. I thought the front ruching would help hide some extra pounds but the cut was so slim I have to return it. Loved the color and fabric though!

Wanted to be able to wear this to work but that was a nogo with how tight and short it was on me. My workplace is pretty flexible on length of dresses/skirts, but this wouldn't have flown even there. For other occasions this would have been lovely."

The color is gorgeous and the heavy knit fabric is super flattering. It was just inappropriately tight and I would've been overly self conscious wearing it.
152702,,12,4,c,42,36,new,,5ft 7in,Alexis,just right,small,830372,Super flattering and appropriate for work. A tad tight and definitely a little thicker then I expected. Not a summer dress but great for fall and winter.

Not too small in the arms which I was worried about. Front on its exceptionally flattering and defines my shape beautifully. From the side and the back though it was a tad unflattering. Not the fault of the dress, more to do with my lumpiness. With a bit of shape wear underneath and maybe a few inches off my hips and I would wear it. I'm on a fitness program at the moment so I'm hoping that in 3 months I'll reach my first goal. If so I'll wear this dress to celebrate! This was my first modcloth purchase and will definitely buy again... It's a shame my first time buyers discount voucher expired before my dress arrived (I'm in Australia). I might treat myself to another dress in time for Christmas."

I tend to wear a medium and thought I was sizing up with a large (as recommended by other reviewers), but this dress was just too tight for me to wear to work. Might be good for occasions for which showing more curves is appropriate, but sadly I will be returning it."

My chest looked gigantic in this dress and, despite my size, I tend to look smaller in the chest than I really am just not in this dress. The rushing at the waist just hung there awkwardly because it was too big. I know a medium would have been even worst as far as the bust is concerned. It will be on its way back as soon as I get printer ink :/"

So this has to go over your head and, for me, that was not easy! Length was great for me, but I'm really short. It might not be long enough for a tall person."

I'm also a sucker for a wrap dress with ruching. However this size L seemed to run really small to me. My chest was boxed in pretty tight and the rest of the dress definitely needed some slack to it. I would have happily ordered the next size up because the dress really was that nice, but it only goes up to a L. I sent it back."
152702,,12,4,d,,34,new,,5ft 7in,ctfay,just right,small,600813,"This is a bodycon dress.  That's the most important thing you should know  and it's not in the description.  The color is gorgeous!  The fabric has a nice substance.  I felt HOT! when I tried it on, and my husbands jaw dropped!  Sadly, I returned it because it just wasn't appropriate for the occasions I needed it for.The one negative thing I would point out on this dress is that the lowest ruching should be eliminated as it hits at weird spot on the hip.  But I worked specialty retailing for years, so I tend to notice that stuff."

I honestly doublechecked the tag four or five times to make sure that I wasn't sent an extrasmall in place of the large that I ordered. I usually fit in M or L with Modcloth, but this dress was ridiculously tiny, which is sad because I love the color and the way it looks on the mannequin."

I'm in a program at school that requires us to dress professionally every day, and this dress has added a great option to my wardrobe. The length is perfect for work/professional settings, hits RIGHT below my knees while standing. The sleeves are not too tight; something I always worry about. The only problem, and only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is the bust. It doesn't fit perfectly but it also isn't horrendous either. It's just a little too big for my boobs. HOWEVER, because of this, it's kind of super perfect for work. I never have to worry about my cleavage being inappropriate. It's lined (the bust, not the entire dress) which is super nice too. Let's see...what else...the fabric is like a jersey stretchy type material which is SUUUUUPER comfortable; wonderful for sitting around in class, making presentations, etc. AND it's not see through, which is a problem I come across often with that kind of material. It's easy to dress up and down, adding a black blazer, a cardigan, heels, chunky boots, etc. All in all, wonderful dress and I highly recommend."

I'm a curvy girl, so things that are fitted in the waist and hips don't always work for me, but this is awesome! The fabric is thick and the ruching hides lumps and bumps.

First off, the material feels very cheap, definitely like 70s polyester. I feel it would have snagged easily. Secondly, it just didn't fit right. It was too small in the shoulders and because of the kick pleat it was too short for my 5'11 legs. It was also skin tight. The silhouette would have been flattering if it had fit."

I was excited when I slipped it on, it hugged everything but didn't show off flaws. I usually wear a Medium but ordered a Large because dresses this shape that I ordered in the past needed to go up a size. It fit perfect in the chest but was way too baggy in the tummy area causing a weird pocket/fold on my left hip that just drives me crazy. It was also a few inches too long for me. Im going to order a Medium and see if it fits any better and then decide if I want to alter or return the original. The green is pretty; not teal at all! It's more dark. My pictures show it darker than it actually is because the lighting in my room is weird."

I'd consider myself a skittle shape (like a hour glass but with chunky legs) and this dress was too loose around my waist, slightly too tight on my thighs and too short to be flattering on my thicker legs. I was contemplating getting a mermaid ruffle added to them hem but I ended up giving it to a pear shaped friend with modelesque legs who it looked stunning on"

The length hits right at the knee and the vee neck doesn't dip too low, so it's appropriate for work, but jazzy enough for dress. The color is more of deep green than a teal to me, and I love matching this dress with a pair of mustard tights and brown Mary Jane heels. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!"

I normally wear a Canadian size 8 (Medium) but ordered this dress in a Large size, given some of the other reviews that I read.  It fits like a glove, but it's a super stretchy material, so it's easy to move in. The color is a wee bit darker than what I thought it was going to be, based on the website photos, but it's gorgeous...definitely a color that can be worn through all seasons!  The only downside about ordering this dress was the amount of Duty and Import Fees that I had to pay...I was a bit surprised by the amount, but that's Canada's fault, not ModCloth's.  Gorgeous dress."

If you are a curvy girl and plan to spend the day playing the role of a potted plant, then this dress is for you. If you are skinny, it'll probably work as well.However, if you are curvy, as soon as you take a few steps, the dress will ride up and become inappropriately short. I guess this will become my goal dress and I will have to work out a bit more to make it perfect."

It looks good on every body type and has some stretch so it looks like it was made just for you. It has the sexiness of a bodycon dress but is super flattering because of the carefully placed ruching. I also love the fact that it can easily transition from day to night with a few swapped out accessories.

I know that I'm in between sizes so when something is more form fitting I usually go up a size and I'm glad that I did.  This dress definitely accentuates your hips but the rushing also makes your waist look tinier which I love.  The neckline is perfect because it's not to low so that means that I can wear it for work or other events where I need to be more covered up!  The only thing was that it was a little tight in the hips for me, but it can easily be resolved by wearing some shapewear, which I usually do with this type of dress anyway!"

The material is thick and stretchy so don't be alarmed when you pull it out of the box and see that there is no zipper. It gives a bit of wiggle room. If anything, I wish it was a little longer, but I knew it was a bit of a gamble when I bought it. Very happy with the purchase, enough that I'm seriously debating on buying it in navy."

So while the material was nice and it fit perfectly everywhere else, I returned it because sitting down felt like I was going to bust a seam. Also of note: because of the fit, a panty line is easily visible."

It looks good, it's very flattering on the figure, the color is a wonderful deep forest green, and the fabric isn't too thin.The only issue I had is with the size. I read the reviews and, being quite a curvy girl, decided to order an L. Well, I'm not sure if it was a good idea. Contrary to reviews, this dress wasn't tight or difficult to put on at all. It's even a little too free in the waist area for my taste. However, it run a little tight on my bottom  not catastrophically, but, well, I could use another inch of two of fabric. Because of it, skirt rides up and I have to pull it down. I still wear it and yes, it's still very much loved... Just not perfect.#forgoodmeasure"

I can never tell what size I'm going to get especially when I can order a medium in some things but the large still doesn't fit in other cases. The color is beautiful but it's just not worth sitting in my closet until I lose 10 pounds. Will be returning this one.

It was very closefitting without feeling tight or uncomfortable, did not ride up when walking. Will have to tack down the kick pleat a bit because it does come up higher than I'm comfortable with. Dress hits me a couple inches above the knee. I actually think it makes me look a size smaller."

It is sexy, without showing a lot of skin. The fabric is nice. Doesn't feel cheep. Can't say enough good things. I may even order it in Navy :)"

My boyfriend had to wear a kilt and the colors complimented each other perfectly. The fit is perfect for those who are a little more on the curvy side but don't want to hide it! The green color is a little darker in person but it still is a beautiful dark emerald color. My only complaint was that I wish the fabric was a little thicker, but overall with the right undergarments it wasn't too sheer. Since I'm 5'8 most dresses run on the shorter side and this dress hits perfectly on my mid thighs. Beautiful!"

The length is great, but the slit goes quite high ( almost to my crotch!), so I will definitely wear opaque tights with this one and tack the slit closed. It does not camouflage my spare tire, but high waisted tights take care of that! It fits with room to spare, which is what I wanted."

It does create a very nice figure and slim the waist. The texture on the waist might make a less curvy girl look bigger than she is, but on a curvier figure it's perfect. It does show some fat around the hips, so you might consider shapewear, but I don't feel it's necessary."

It looks great on, but I knocked off a star because it's *quite* snug, and I got it to wear to the office. I'm always a little selfconscious about how bootylicious this dress makes me look.

I'm tallish, 5'8, and hourglassshaped, 34DDE3040, an bought a large (which is my usual size for clothes sized this way). It fits great in my bust, which is usually the area I fear garments won't fit. It's a bit loose in my waist, but looks and feels great. The hips and length are a huge problem. It's so snug on my hips that even pulling it down, it clung to them. You can see my butt cheeks through the slit while I'm just standing there and trying to sit provides a fullon peep show! I have curvy hips, but my bootie is pretty flat. It hits several inches above my knees. I'd classify this as a mini. I don't think I've ever had a problem with something fitting everywhere but my hips. I honestly think this dress is for gals UNDER 5'6 and/or not curvy. Maybe a size up would help, but since it fit everywhere else, I don't know if it'll add enough length and be too loose everywhere else. Beautiful color, cut and thick fabric and the price is great (you don't even miss a liner). I'm really sad this doesn't work for me."

I got a large, and I'm glad I did. I'm typically a size 8, so this may not be the dress for you if you're generally larger than that. This dress is very form fitting, and a bit hard to get on and off, but once it's on, it does fantastic things for your figure.  I love the length, too. I'm tall, so it's hard to find dresses that don't leave me feeling too exposed, but this one was very comfortable."

The large is snug but not unflattering. Really was happy with my purchase. Perhaps its my hips but it does pull at one of the pleats in the side and the result is that one pleat sticks out further than the other. Its doesn't bother me though. Overall I am happy with this dress and will be wearing it to a wedding in the fall. Just like some of the other reviewers said, the fabric is soft and stretchy. I love it :)"

I bought it to wear to a wedding in October and I'm pretty sure, other than the bride of course, I will be the best dressed person there.

I was a little hesitant when I first took it out of the box but when I slipped it on...it gave me curves in places I didn't know I had curves.  The fabric is soft to the touch and with a slip and appropriate undergarments you too can bring out your inner vixen.  MEOW

It does wonderful things to my figure in all the right places. I have an hourglass shape, and usually have a hard time finding dresses that not only accommodate my large bust, but also highlight my waist without looking like I'm trying too hard.

The stretch is perfect, comfortable and, like others have mentioned, the ruching does a lot to cover any tummy problems.  My only complaint is that the faux wrap at the top almost covers too far over, so it makes my already large chest look larger.  Nothing horrible, just mildly annoying.  The color was just what I was expecting!"

That's due to the stretch in the fabric, which I'm sure would accommodate a range of proportions quite prettily.  It's a wonderfully sturdy knit, and the ruching helps camouflage tummy and hip lumpsalthough controltop hose is required for me to smooth things out overall. I would call the colour more of a forest green than teal, but maybe I'm expecting more blue tones in a teal. The cap sleeves are perfect, as I prefer not baring my whole arm (sometimes hard to find in fitted dresses).  The back slit comes up a bit high, and like most tight clothing the skirt tends to ride up a bit, so I may tack the top closed just for my own peace of mind (or compulsively tug it down LOL). I love the Vneck, not too deep but still flirty and flattering.  Very high quality for the price."
152702,,12,3,b,35,36,new,,5ft 6in,Karen,just right,large,569326,"This fit very strangely.  It was a little too large just about everywhere, but the worst part was the shirring: it stood out awkwardly from the dress and went down to the thighs so that, when viewed in profile, it looked like I had weird lumps sticking out from my body.  I had to send it back."
152702,,12,5,dd/e,41,38,new,41,5ft 9in,Amy,just right,fit,897904,"This dress was...okay.  Just okay.  I purchased it primarily because I love the color (and this dress is definitely EMERALD, not teal, which is a good thing) and because I hoped the ruching would give the illusion of having more of a waistline than I actually do (because I'm not a curvy girl).  I was surprised by how heavy the material is and I imagine it wouldn't be good in the summer heat.  The biggest problem I can see with this dress is that I would probably mess with the ruching constantly because it doesn't stay in place and the dress rides up (at least it did on my figure).  This would probably be a great dress for someone with an hourglass figure...unfortunately, that isn't me."

I'm normally a size 8/10 (8 pants, 10 dress) and went with the reviews that advised sizing up for a little extra room and got the Large, however, I think my broad shoulders and back were just not going to work with this dress. It made me look even more like a football player than I already do. I think it's ideal for those with normal sized shoulders, as most that have posted pics look amazing in this dress. I was tempted to keep it and try to make it work, but I just don't think it would for me. I do HIGHLY recommend it though for those who can pull it off. It is an amazing dress!"

You could play it up with accessories and color for a sexier look or pair with a cardigan for a more conservative outfit.

152702,,12,4,d,36,34,new,,5ft 4in,Megan,just right,fit,818605,"This dress is wonderful! The colour is amazing and it's a great length (not too short). It's a bit low in the front but I put a safety pin and it's perfect. :)  I feel like some of the reviews maybe hyped it up a bit too much, it didn't cover all my flaws, in fact one of the folds hits my hip kind of funny and almost accentuates my stomach, though when I adjust it it stays and then it looks fine."
152702,,12,3,b,,36,new,,5ft 6in,ashur064,just right,small,133621,"As a first time shopper of Mod Cloth, I was super excited to see how this purchase would turn out. Alas, though it is pretty, for a thrifty shopper like me (and particularly those who have to pay shipping/import taxes to Canada) I don't know that it's entirely worth the 50$. (This came to nearly 80$ when shipping and boarder fees were added.) While I do normally wear a large size these days, despite the pleasant stretch of the material and the aid of shape wear, it will be a while before I will be fitting myself into this dress without looking pregnant. The fabric itself is soft to the touch, though it is not as thick/structured as I had assumed from the other descriptions. The colour is beautiful, though I did also have to go around snipping little seam ends off from sleeves, hems, etc, as there were 12 threads sort of dangling off of random places. Lastly, even just in wearing this around my house to see what I could get away with, I noticed that the back slit tends to ride up. Perhaps this is because I carry my weight around my middle, or perhaps this is because I have a shorter torso and longer legs  but as a teacher, I'd be weary wearing this in front of children, as, a two room walk away, I realized that the stop of the slit was sitting at the very bottom of my rear. In terms of length though, the dress stops right above my knee. The overall silhouette would be very attractive, were it not for the expansion of the ruching across my apparently broad midsection!"
152702,,12,5,dd/e,,36,new,,5ft,kraney0223,just right,fit,56735,"This dress is perfect! It is certainly more of an emerald/forest green than teal, but the color is still beautiful. I was worried about getting it on since it didn't have a zipper, but it wiggled on perfectly. The cut and style of the dress are great in that it shows off my shape but the ruching gives me a little extra coverage over areas Im not as confident about so I feel super confident wearing it!"
152702,,12,5,dd/e,43,36,new,41,5ft 9in,Mandy,just right,fit,75080,As a previous reviewer stated its a bit scary when this dress shows up and there is no zipper. But have no fear (yes no fear for even the curvy girls!) this dress is SUUUUUPER stretchy.The dress itself fit like a glove and even though the dress is super stretchy the fabric and style of the dress doesn't make it look cheap and doesn't accent any flaw areas. In fact I was really impressed with how well it hid them. The only issue I had with it is the kick pleat in black was a little high cut. I think this may be because of my height too though. The dress is said to be longer length but only really comes to my knees. But quickly pinning the kick pleat solved the problem. It's a great dress for office/etc wear. I'm really happy that this and two other dresses I purchased here are the same brand. Had I known that they were I think I would have bought it and the Bright Path Dress sooner when I bought the Profesh Start Dress a couple weeks ago. I think it would be a great idea if ModCloth started listing the brands of some of the smaller/less known brands you guys sell on here. If I knew that some of the outfits/dresses/etc where similar styles/brands to ones I already purchased I would be more eager to buy them b/c I know how they usually fit. I also feel a size chart based off brand would be SUPER helpful too. :)

But if your hourglass figure  is a little less extreme than mine, this dress will still do the trick. I'm always on the hunt for dresses that 'hug' me all over, and aren't fo flabby around the waist (29 inch) or pull at the hips (40 inch). Well, guess what, this dress makes it happen. It stretches as far as my hips ask it to, but bounces back wherever it finds room. Hourglass all the way. An added bonus: the fabric is thick enough to provide extra support and oompf in the bust area and boost my cleavage in all the right ways.The color is the exact same rich forest green as in the picture  combined with my ginger/strawberry hair it pops out wonderfully.Do mind that there's a split in te back, that for me ends up just  but only just  below the butt. Losing a few inches in that particular area will make this dress fit and look even better, but for now, high heels pump up the derriere just right. Now, I just need to wait for the right occasion to share my new love with the world. (I might find a change to upload a photo then!)"
152702,,12,4,ddd/f,43,34,new,39,5ft 6in,Madeline,just right,fit,295071,"Love it. I got it for a wedding, wore it with heels, pearls, and an updo, and it was perfect. Retro and vampy without being scandalous. And so versatile that the next week I wore it with boots and a blazer to work! I'll be getting this in the pink. I like the way it fit, but if I wanted to be a little more vampy I would've gotten a medium (but then it would be more of a Friday night only dress). Also, it pills sort of fast, so wash cold or hand wash. Overall, I love it!"

Also, the folds/pleats from were resting awkwardly on me.  The next day I gave it another try and BOOM  in love.  I wore a different bra, threw on some heels and realized this might be one of the best dresses I own.  The quality is outstanding. The length is perfect. Those folds in the front hide all imperfections. I simply love this dress!"

Perfect perfect fit. You won't be disappointed!The quality of the dress is a cotton / spandex blend so remember to dry it flat. I love the fact that you don't need to iron it even. As others have mentioned, just take note that the colour is nowhere near teal (IMO it's a forest green rather than emerald) but I thought the whole dress worked! One of my favourites to date! :)"
152702,,12,5,b,35,36,new,,5ft 8in,Jennifer,just right,fit,670444,I lost weight in the last year so this is the perfect figure flattering dress! I cant wait to wear it out. Owning outfits like this will hopefully encourage me to keep eating healthy!
